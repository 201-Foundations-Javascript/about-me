                Good Evening, my name is Bryant. I served 8 years as an Aviation Operations Specialist. During my time I
                served on 5 deployments. I also self taught myself how to use access database to be able to better
                improve the ground departments capability and ultimately save time. I have taken courses on HTML, CSS,
                C++ and computer architecture since I was in high school. It has been a long time so I feel like i'm
                re-learning everything again. I got out of the Marines in 2012 and been struggling to find the right
                career path and decided to give code fellows a try for coding seems to be a relatively good paying job
                and stable market. If all goes well i'd love to attend most of the 401 courses to make myself more
                competitive. I also am a gamer, hiker, camper, dog owner.

                I graduated High School in 2004 and shortly after joined the military. During my time in the service I
                attended online classes as well as other military type educational courses. After getting out in 2012
                i've attended several colleges drom Devry University for operational management, Community College of
                San Diego for Information Technology, South Seattle College for Network Security and north Seattle
                College for Software Engineer.

                I worked as a janitor and at a local cd store cleaning cd's and organizing them when I was in high
                school. I served 8 years as an Aviation operations Specialist in the Marine Corps. When I got out in
                2012 as an Aviation Operations Chief. I've been a warehouse manager, special projects lead for a
                warehouse, foreman for a moving company, custom designer for a cutting board manufacturer and a security
                guard since then.

                I've been into web development since I was in high school. I'd love to create mobile or other games and
                mobile or other applications. I'm hoping to learn the right path to take by time 301 is complete so I
                can take 2 401 courses.
